_With over 15 years of experience, my journey took me from Paris to Montreal, then Copenhagen, wearing many hats in my career._
_I have notably managed Platform Engineering and Development teams, helped some spring, and actively participated in transforming others toward Agile and DevOps methodologies._
_Also acting as a Product Owner and Service Manager, I have acquired an entrepreneurial mindset. I’m inclusive, open-minded and can bring people together which helps me resolve conflicts and help people go in the same direction._

_Today, I would love to offer these skills in helping develop and evolve your teams and their practices, as well as your organization._
