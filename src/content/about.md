_I’m Baptiste!_

_With over 15 years of experience, my journey took me from Paris to Montreal, and then Copenhagen, wearing many hats in my career. I don’t fear change, I embrace it. I like to challenge the status quo and always evolve._

_I have notably managed applicative and DevOps / Platform Engineering, and development teams, helped some spring, and actively participated in transforming others toward Agile and DevOps methodologies._

_Also acting as a Product Owner and Service Manager in my career, I have acquired an entrepreneurial mindset._

_I am inclusive, open-minded and can bring people together which helps me resolve conflicts and help people go in the same direction._

_I am a people-first type of manager. I favor empathy and candor, which in turn helps build a relationship of trust. I aim at helping people be their best self, whether it be professionally or as a person._

_I have helped onboard managers, and mentored some more junior ones._

_My goal is to be able to grow in a more strategic and “leader of leaders” position._

_Today, I would love to offer these skills in helping develop and evolve your teams and their practices, as well as your organization._
